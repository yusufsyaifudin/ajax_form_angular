# Angular File Upload
## Angular form via ajax

This is simplest way to make an file upload to angular or even just jQuery. I documented this and upload to github because of reason: *I am tired of searching how to upload a file with ajax with the most simple way. And I thank God (and sure, Google too) for helping me find this code.*

The jquery.form.js plugin is originally come from [https://github.com/malsup/form](https://github.com/malsup/form) so this code is also under MIT or GPL license.
